/**
 * Hook for executing contract write operations (create, withdraw, cancel streams).

 *   - Wallet connection checks and error handling
 *   - Transaction step tracking (simulate → sign → submit → confirm)
 *   - Toast notifications for user feedback
 *   - Automatic stream cache invalidation on success
 *   - Error mapping and recovery
 *
 * @returns {Object} Contract operations and state
 * @returns {Function} createStream - Create a new stream from input parameters
 * @returns {Function} createStreamsBatch - Create multiple streams in one atomic transaction (up to 20)
 * @returns {Function} withdraw - Withdraw unlocked funds from a stream by ID
 * @returns {Function} cancel - Cancel a stream; sender gets remainder, recipient keeps unlocked
 * @returns {Function} cleanup - Permanently remove a completed or cancelled stream from history
 * @returns {Function} withdrawAll - Withdraw from multiple streams in sequence, with progress tracking
 * @returns {Function} estimateFee - Estimate the fee for creating a stream (returns null if wallet disconnected)
 * @returns {boolean} pending - True while any transaction is being executed
 * @returns {string|null} error - Error message from the last failed operation, or null
 *
 * @throws {Error} "Connect a wallet first." - If any operation is called without a connected wallet
 *
 * @example
 * const { createStream, pending, error } = useContract()
